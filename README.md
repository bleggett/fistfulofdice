Need a contrived excuse to fiddle with Go, goroutines, and channels.

All this does is accept an argument in the D&D format 'NdX', and initiates 'N' number of "dice rolls" as goroutines that sleep for one second before returning a random result between 1 and 'X'.

This is, of course, completely useless. But it was educational.
